# Your Value Proposition

What can you do that others can't do? Why are you valuable? What do you bring to the company that someone else can't?
What is hard that you can make easy?
What is a problem you share with at least one other person you can solve in a modular way?

First, look presentable:

Clean up your code:
console.logs
README.md
blog explaining your work
YouTube video explaining your work.
Pick a project and code it live on Twitch or YouTube or , even if it's a tutorial.
